    <p><strong><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrinax'>Thrinax</a> + Wax = Thriwax</strong><br/><br/>
        Thriwax is a multi-genre ambient artist, but for us he recorded a mix of broken rhythms interspersed with hypnotic sound<br/> structures, breaks and a dead drum.<br/><br/> He started his project in 2018 with the presentation of the album in the clubs "NII" and "Club",<br/> and also played in Kazan's Werk and other clubs.<br/><br/> In his work, he is inspired by the metamorphoses of the weather.
